I have a Ph.D. in Computer Science. My research was focused on the design, development and implementation of a website platform to help college students learn mathematics. I'm passionate about educational technology. Therefore, since I finished grad school a have been working on different educational projects. At present, I'm an Instructional Design Consultant at Shmoop where I design courses to help people learn Computer Science and I'm collaborating with the Computer History Museum designing activities for schools. My other big fascination is web design. I enjoy the combination of a well-structured interface, with appropriate typography and color and a interesting content. For that reason I appreciate participating in projects where I can improve my knowledge in user experience and front-end technologies.
